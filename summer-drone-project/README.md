# 🛸 Summer Drone Project (2025)

This is my personal project for summer 2025 — building and programming a quadcopter from scratch as a first-year Mechanical Engineering student at UofT.

---

## 📌 Project Goals

- Build a stable, flyable quadcopter using pre-made components
- Learn and implement PID-based flight control
- Learn basic CAD, embedded programming, and data logging

---

## 🧠 Skills Learned

- CAD modeling
- Wiring, soldering, and circuit integration
- Arduino/C++ programming
- PID control + IMU data handling

---

## 🛠️ Components Used (partial list)



(Full list in [`BOM.md`](./BOM.md))

---

## 📘 Lessons Learned

1. PID tuning is a challenge — needs trial and error.
2. Sensor noise needs filtering (especially IMU).
